% Note that the actual abstract submission process must now be done
% by filling out a web form at
% 
%    http://abs.aps.org/
% 
% However, it is recommended to prepare your abstract using this
% template, so that all co-authors can agree on all the details.
% Then, when the time comes to submit the abstract, you will have
% just have to cut and paste the information from this abstract
% into the APS web page.
% 
% Note that it is permissible to use latex constructs in author,
% title, and abstract entries when filling the web form.
%
% This version of the template is appropriate for contributed
% abstracts.  Invited abstracts can be up to 2000 characters
% in length, so the size settings may not be right for them.
%
% For pointers about the process of submitting the abstract to the
% APS web site, see http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/~dhv/aps_abstracts/ .

% Note: Affiliations do NOT need to include the address information.
%       I suggest to keep it short.  If you wish, it could be, e.g.,
%       "Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rutgers University"
%       but the shorter the better.

% Note: In the case of multiple authors with the same affiliation,
%       the affiliation should be left blank except for the last
%       author of the series.  When it comes time to do the actual
%       web submission, if you click "Same as Submitter" to fill
%       out the information for the first author, you might have to
%       erase the Affiliation information if the second author is
%       at the same institution.

% This is NOT counted against the length limit.  If you include
% it, it will be formatted as Reference 1; if you also include

ABSTRACT:
% -------------------------------------------

Here is a dummy abstract.  Note that LaTex notations (e.g,
equations like $x^y$ and special characters as in Schr\"odinger)
are allowed; they are also allowed in title and author names.
Citations can also be added using the footnote method
like this.\footnote{M. Self, M. Friend and M. Adviser,
PRB {\bf 110}, 123456 (2014).}
Paragraph breaks are not allowed.  There is a {\bf firm length limit of
1300 characters} which is counted by the number of characters in
the text portion of the abstract, that is, in this paragraph.
Unfortunately, LaTeX notations count by the input, so that
\$$\backslash$epsilon\$ counts as 10 characters, not 1.
